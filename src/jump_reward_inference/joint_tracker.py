This is the user script of the causal deterministic jump-back reward inference model on the proposed 1D state space.

The model first takes the waveform to the spectral domain and then feeds them into one of the pre-trained BeatNet models to obtain beat/downbeat activations.
Finally, the activations are used in a jump-reward inference model to infer beats, downbeats, tempo, and meter. 

system input: Raw audio waveform 

System output: a vector with beats, downbeats, local tempo, and local meter columns, respectively.  shape (num_beats, 4).
